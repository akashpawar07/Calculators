# Calculators

When I was in college these are the three simple javascript projects that i have made during college, 

first I made a simple calculator, then I thought I should make a more advanced and better looking calculator,
i tried my best in these calcy.
After completion of these two calculator, it boost my confidence about the javascript's other fucntion or method.
